# Spatial Clustering

Spatial clustering aims to group of a large number of geographic areas or points into a smaller number of regions based on similiarities in one or more variables. Spatially constrained clustering is needed when clusters are required to be spatially contiguous. 

In rgeoda v0.0.3, there are three different approaches explicitly incorporate the contiguity constraint in the optimization process: SKATER, Redcap and Max-p. More more details, please read the lab note that Dr. Luc Anselin wrote: http://geodacenter.github.io/workbook/8_spatial_clusters/lab8.html 

For example, to apply spatial clustering on the Guerry dataset, we use the queen weights to define the spatial contiguity and select 6 variables for similarity measure: "Crm_prs", "Crm_prp", "Litercy", "Donatns", "Infants", "Suicids". 

The following code is used to get a 2D data list for the selected variables:

```{r}
data <- list(guerry$table$Crm_prs, guerry$table$Crm_prp, guerry$table$Litercy, guerry$table$Donatns, guerry$table$Infants, guerry$table$Suicids)
```

## SKATER

The Spatial C(K)luster Analysis by Tree Edge Removal(SKATER) algorithm introduced by Assuncao et al. (2006) is based on the optimal pruning of a minimum spanning tree that reflects the contiguity structure among the observations. It provides an optimized algorithm to prune to tree into several clusters that their values of selected variables are as similar as possible.

The SKATER function in rgeoda: 
```r
skater(k, w, data, distance_method='euclidean', bound_vals = [],  min_bound = 0, random_seed=123456789)
```

```{block, type='rmdinfo'}
The parameters `distance_method`, `bound_vals`, `min_bound` and `random_seed` are optional.
```

```{block, type='rmdtip'}
See [Max-p] for the usage of  `bound_vals` and `min_bound`.
```

For example, to create 4 spatially contiguous clusters using `skater()` with Guerry dataset, the queen weights and the values of the 6 selected variables:
```{r}
guerry_clusters <- skater(4, queen_w, data)
```

This `skater()` function returns a 2D list, which represents 4 clusters. Each cluster is composed by several contiguity areas, e.g. 15, 74, 16, 55, 60, 39, 68, 33, 17, 82, 81, 0, 2, 40, 20, 80

rgeoda also provides utility functions to compute some descriptive statistics of the clustering results, e.g. to compute the ratio of between to total sum of squares:


```{r}
betweenss <- between_sumofsquare(guerry_clusters, data)
totalss <- total_sumofsquare( data)
ratio <-  betweenss / totalss
cat("The ratio of between to total sum of square:", ratio)
```

## REDCAP

REDCAP (Regionalization with dynamically constrained agglomerative clustering and partitioning) is developed by D. Guo (2008). Like SKATER, REDCAP starts from building a spanning tree with 3 different ways (single-linkage, average-linkage, and the complete-linkage). The single-linkage way leads to build a minimum spanning tree. Then,REDCAP provides 2 different ways (first‐order and full-order constraining) to prune the tree to find clusters. The first-order approach with a minimum spanning tree is exactly the same with SKATER. In GeoDa and rgeoda, the following methods are provided:

* First-order and Single-linkage
* Full-order and Complete-linkage
* Full-order and Average-linkage
* Full-order and Single-linkage

For example, to find 4 clusters using the same dataset and weights as above using REDCAP with Full-order and Complete-linkage method:

```{r}
redcap_clusters <- redcap(4, queen_w, data, "fullorder-completelinkage")
redcap_clusters

betweenss <- between_sumofsquare(redcap_clusters, data)
totalss <- total_sumofsquare( data)
ratio <- betweenss / totalss
cat("The ratio of between to total sum of square:", ratio)
```

## Max-p

The so-called max-p regions model (outlined in Duque, Anselin, and Rey 2012) uses a different approach and considers the regionalization problem as an application of integer programming. In addition, the number of regions is determined endogenously.

The algorithm itself consists of a search process that starts with an initial feasible solution and iteratively improves upon it while maintaining contiguity among the elements of each cluster. Like Geoda, rgeoda provides three different heuristic algorithms to find an optimal solution for max-p:

* greedy
* Tabu Search
* Simulated Annealing

Unlike SKATER and REDCAP that one can specify the number of clusters as an input paramter, max-p doesn't allow to specify the number of clusters explicitly, but a constrained variable and the minimum bounding value that each cluster should reach that are used to find an optimized number of clusters.

For example, to use `greedy` algorithm in maxp function with the same dataset and weights as above to find optimal clusters using max-p:

First, we need to specify, for example, every cluster must have population >= 3236.67 thousands people:
```{r}
bound_vals <- guerry$table$Pop1831
min_bound <- 3236.67 # 10% of Pop1831
```

Then, we can call the max-p function with "greedy" algorith, the bound values and minimum bound value:

```{r}
maxp_clusters <- maxp(queen_w, data, bound_vals, min_bound, "greedy")

betweenss <- between_sumofsquare(maxp_clusters, data)
ratio <- betweenss / totalss
cat("The ratio of between to total sum of square:", ratio)
```

We can also specify using `tabu search` algorithm in maxp function with the parameter of tabu length:

```{r}
maxp_tabu_clusters <- maxp(queen_w, data, bound_vals, min_bound, "tabu", tabu_length=95)

betweenss <- between_sumofsquare(maxp_tabu_clusters, data)
ratio <- betweenss / totalss
cat("The ratio of between to total sum of square:", ratio)
```

To apply `simulated annealing` algorithm in maxp function with the parameter of cooling rate:

```{r}
maxp_sa_clusters <- maxp(queen_w, data, bound_vals, min_bound, "sa", cool_rate=0.75)

betweenss <- between_sumofsquare(maxp_sa_clusters, data)
ratio <- betweenss / totalss
cat("The ratio of between to total sum of square:", ratio)
```

We can also increase the number of iterations for local search process by specifying the parameter `initial` (default value is 99):

```{r}
maxp_clusters <- maxp(queen_w, data, bound_vals, min_bound, "greedy", initial=1000)

betweenss <- between_sumofsquare(maxp_clusters, data)
ratio <- betweenss / totalss
cat("Tratio of between to total sum of square:", ratio)
```
